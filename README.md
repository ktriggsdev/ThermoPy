# ThermoPy
A simple program that displays the current temperature in a chosen city using a thermometer display

## Changelog: 
04/11/2023 - 20:11 - Program no longer spams the seperator() function and instead uses for loops to populate the app with seperators, **yay more efficiency!**

04/11/2023 - 20:14 - List of requirements in requirements.txt has been reduced, **:D**

05/11/2023 - 13:13 - Color Values were changed to reflect how hot a city would actually feel like. for instance a city with 27 degrees celcuius would appear red instead of orange. **such a hot update, or cold, depending on the city**
